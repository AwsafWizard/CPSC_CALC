# CPSC_CALC
This is a fun project I did. This is basically a program which, according to the marking rules of our school gives us a result after we give it the necessary inputs.

I made this program using Tkinter module of python.

Modes: This program has 4 modes. In CPSC Mode, we enter Obtained marks in Term End Exam, CT Marks and subject codes. Then taking 10% marks from CT Marks and 90% marks from the Obtained Marks, gives us Final Marks and Grade Point Average - GPA. The Grade Point Average - GPA calculations are different in CPSC Mode Class 9-10. In Averaging Mode, it makes Average of two Marks we enter and gives the average value with GPA. And in Summation Mode, it makes the sum of the marks with GPA.

Features: I integrated some cool features in the program. For example, we can save the results/outputs of CPSC Mode and Averaging Mode though it is a bit glitchy. It has a history feature with saves the results of last 5 inputs of CPSC Mode. We can change the color of program and make the window opaque or transparent.
